# Product Requirements (PRD) — Finager India

Purpose
- Single workspace for CA firms to manage multiple client businesses: GST filings (GSTR-1, GSTR-2B, reconciliation), accounting reports (P&L, Balance Sheet, Trial Balance), and audit workflows (Form 3CD, checklists).

Primary users
- Chartered Accountant firms (multi-user workspaces) and their client businesses (upload documents, view reports, approve filings).

Core flows (high level)
- Workspace & firm setup: firm creates workspace, invites team members and clients.
- Client onboarding: client account creation, secure document upload, basic KYC metadata.
- Accounting intake: import/Journals/upload CSV / integrate with ledgers; generate Trial Balance, P&L, Balance Sheet.
- GST lifecycle: collect invoices → auto-match → produce GSTR-1 / compare GSTR-2B → reconciliation reports → filing workflow with CA approval.
- Audit workflows: generate Form 3CD checklist, attach evidence, track reviewer comments and signoffs.

Non-functional requirements
- Data privacy: client data separation per workspace, encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Performance: dashboard loads < 400ms for typical firm with 100 clients (target).
- Compliance: follow Indian GST and audit record retention rules.

Success metrics
- Time-to-file reduction for CA firms (target 30% faster).
- Adoption: % of invited clients who upload documents within 7 days.
- Accuracy: % reduction in reconciliation exceptions after automated matching.

Constraints & integrations
- Integrate with common accounting exports (Tally/CSV), GST APIs or file formats, OAuth for identity providers.
- Multi-tenant data model: strict workspace boundaries; role-based access control.

Release & priorities (initial MVP)
1. Firm workspace, user management, client accounts, document upload.
2. Basic accounting reports (Trial Balance, P&L).
3. GSTR-1 generation and GSTR-2B reconciliation reports.
4. Filing workflow and client approval flows.
5. Audit checklist (Form 3CD) generator and evidence attachments.

How to use this rule
- This rule is always applied to conversations in the project to guide product decisions, acceptance criteria, and scope discussions. Keep it concise and refer back when making trade-offs.
